Sometimes it's slow, it isn't clear
It surfaces, it disappears
It starts to glow when you are near
My features gone, on my soul
I disappear, I lose control
I take a dive and let it go

Trying to be patient through the rising pulse
Trying to be careful with the overflow
Feel the metal of the ladder
Anticipate the water, water, oh

My features gone, on my soul
I disappear, I lose control
I watch myself move far below

Trying to be patient through the rising pulse
Trying to be careful with the overflow
Deep water colored vision
Ripples across decisions

Deep ripples, envision
Deep water colored vision
Deep ripples, clouds my vision
Deep water colored vision
