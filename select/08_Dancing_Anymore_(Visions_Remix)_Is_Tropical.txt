No I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way

No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst to sway
No I don't anymore

No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way

No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst to sway
No I don't anymore

You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh you don't take me dancing anymore
Always been the wrong time
To ... on the floor
Always been the wrong time
To ... on the floor

No I won't, no I won't
No I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way

No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst to sway
No I don't anymore

Oh you don't take me dancing anymore
Always been the wrong time
To ... on the floor
Always been the wrong time
To ... on the floor
